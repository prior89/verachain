# VeraChain Complete Testing and Fix Request

## Current Status
The VeraChain application is fully coded with real services (no mocks), but needs testing and compatibility fixes before running.

## Critical Issue to Fix
**TensorFlow.js Installation Error on Windows with Node.js v22**
- Error: Cannot install @tensorflow/tfjs-node due to Node v22 compatibility
- Visual Studio build tools requirement issue
- Need alternative solution or workaround

## Testing Request

### 1. Fix Installation Issues
```bash
# Current error when running:
cd backend
npm install
# Error: @tensorflow/tfjs-node fails with Node v22

# Please fix by either:
- Use @tensorflow/tfjs (browser version) instead of tfjs-node
- Implement fallback to ML5.js
- Create mock AI service temporarily
- Or provide any working alternative
```

### 2. Start Both Servers
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd C:\Users\VeraChain\backend
npm install  # Fix any errors first
npm run seed  # Create sample data
npm start  # Should run on port 5000

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd C:\Users\VeraChain\frontend
npm install  # Fix ESLint conflicts if any
npm start  # Should run on port 3000
```

### 3. Test All Features

#### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Login with test1@test.com / password
- [ ] Register new user account
- [ ] Verify JWT token works
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Check profile page displays correctly

#### UI/UX Verification
- [ ] Confirm NO emojis or icons (text only)
- [ ] Verify purple theme (#8B5CF6) is applied
- [ ] Check white background (#FFFFFF)
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify bottom nav has only HOME | CERTIFICATES | PROFILE

#### Core Feature Tests
- [ ] Test dual verification scan flow:
  - Product scan → Certificate scan → NFT generation
- [ ] Verify NFT card 3D flip animation works
- [ ] Test advertisement rotation on main screen
- [ ] Check profile page shows:
  - Email, member since, tier
  - Total authentications, NFTs owned
  - NO avatar, NO success rate

#### Real Services Verification
- [ ] AI Service: Verify TensorFlow.js or alternative works
- [ ] OCR Service: Test Tesseract.js Korean + English extraction
- [ ] Blockchain: Confirm Polygon Amoy connection via Alchemy

  RPC: https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/3bYhEJy3MLCkCVHczuFMc
  Chain ID: 80002
  Wallet: 0x8d907C897faa884d3D38B00c4066E774d9D62305
  ```
- [ ] Smart Contract: Verify deployment readiness

#### Privacy Requirements Check
- [ ] Confirm NO transaction history visible anywhere
- [ ] Verify new certificate IDs generated each time
- [ ] Check previous ownership data is hidden
- [ ] Test burn-and-mint pattern for NFT transfers

### 4. Fix Any Errors Found

Common issues to address:
- ESLint configuration conflicts
- Missing npm packages
- MongoDB connection issues
- CORS errors between frontend and backend
- MetaMask connection problems

### 5. Provide Test Results Report

After testing, provide:
1. List of all working features ✅
2. List of any remaining issues ❌
3. Screenshots or descriptions of each screen
4. Confirmation that real services work (no mocks)
5. Steps to deploy smart contract to Polygon Amoy

## Expected Outcome

After completing this request:
- Both servers run without errors
- All features work with test accounts
- Real services connected and functional
- Application ready for:
  - Demo to investors
  - Beta testing with users
  - Polygon grant application
  - Smart contract deployment

## Alternative Solutions

If TensorFlow.js cannot be fixed:
1. Use browser-based TensorFlow.js in frontend
2. Implement with ML5.js instead
3. Use cloud-based AI API (temporary)
4. Create working mock that simulates real behavior

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Application runs on Windows with Node.js v22
- ✅ No installation errors
- ✅ All features testable with test accounts
- ✅ Real services working (AI, OCR, Blockchain)
- ✅ Privacy-first approach maintained
- ✅ Ready for Polygon Amoy deployment
- ✅ Demo-ready for investors

## Test Accounts
```
Email: test1@test.com / Password: password
Email: test2@test.com / Password: password
Email: admin@test.com / Password: password
```

## Final Deliverables

1. Working application (frontend + backend)
2. Fixed package.json with correct dependencies
3. Clear instructions for running the app
4. List of any remaining tasks for production
5. Deployment guide for Polygon Amoy
